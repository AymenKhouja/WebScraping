# WebScraping
This repository contains my webscraping project, the starting database, the code and the resulting final database. 
The aim of the project is to find certain informations about different entreprises. In this project, our aim was to get the facebook, instagram and linkedin pages of 100 entreprises as well as their websites and their logos. 
To do so I've written a webscraping algorithm using R, and making use of the packages rvest and httr to make the mission doable.
